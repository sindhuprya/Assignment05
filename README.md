# Assignment05
This repository contains two Python programs demonstrating fundamental Python concepts, including dictionaries, user input handling, and list slicing.

# Task 1: Create a Dictionary of Student Marks
Description

This program creates a dictionary containing student names as keys and their corresponding marks as values. It allows the user to input a student’s name and retrieves the marks for that student. If the student is not found, the program displays an appropriate message.

Features

Creates a dictionary of student marks

Accepts user input for a student’s name

Retrieves and displays the corresponding marks

Handles the case when the student name is not present in the dictionary

Sample Output

When the student exists:

Enter the student's name: Bob
Bob's marks are: 92


When the student does not exist:

Enter the student's name: John
Student 'John' not found in the records.

# File Name
5as1.py

# Task 2: Demonstrate List Slicing
Description

This program demonstrates Python list slicing. It creates a list of numbers from 1 to 10, extracts the first five elements, reverses the extracted list, and prints both the extracted and reversed lists.

Features

Creates a list of numbers from 1 to 10

Extracts the first five elements using list slicing

Reverses the extracted list

Prints both the extracted list and the reversed list

Sample Output
Extracted list (first five elements): [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Reversed extracted list: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
